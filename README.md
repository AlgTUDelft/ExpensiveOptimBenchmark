<!-- TODO: Better name! -->

<!-- TODO: Insert general idea of why this benchmark is needed here -->

## Usage

Running this benchmark requires a working installation of python 3. 

- A virtualenv can be created through the use of [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry), which will automatically incorporate the neccesary dependencies:
    ```
    poetry install
    ```
- Once finished, you can open a shell in the virtualenv by running
    ```
    poetry shell
    ```
    or run a singular command using
    ```
    poetry run python ...
    ```
<!-- TODO: Once added, add method for running approach here -->
