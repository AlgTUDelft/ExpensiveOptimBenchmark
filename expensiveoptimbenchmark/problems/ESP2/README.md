This folder contains modified versions of the problem suite found at https://bitbucket.org/arahat/cfd-test-problem-suite/src/master/
The original licence of the code can be found in this folder under `LICENSE`. 
Unless listed below the files have identical names to their originals.
- `createBafflesDict2.py` is based upon `createBafflesDict.py`
- `evaluateSimulation2.py` is based upon `evaluateSimulation.py`

As such these modifications add a new variant of the ESP problem (hereafter named ESP2),
as an example of a mixed type problem.
This variant requires a dicrete choice for picking the kind of plate (None, Closed, Perforated, Angled).
With the latter utilising a new continuous variable that determines the angle for each plate.

One needs to copy the files to the right place:
- `dockerCall.sh` and `dockerCall.py` go into the default working directory of the container.
- `createBafflesDict2.py` and `evaluateSimulation2.py` go into `./Exeter_CFD_Problems/ESP`


After doing so ESP2 can be ran in the container as follows:
```
dockerCall.sh ESP2 <baffleConfiguration>
```
where `<baffleConfiguration>` is a string of `<int in [0, 3]>,<float in [28, 146]>` for each of the 49 baffles, concatenated together and separated using commas.

Example:
```
